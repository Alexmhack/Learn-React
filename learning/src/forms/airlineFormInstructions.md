Challenge: Wire up the partially-finished travel form so that it works!
Remember to use the concept of controlled forms
https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html

All information should be populating the text below the form in real-time
as you're filling it out

This exercise is adapted from the V School curriculum on vanilla JS forms:
